# {baseurl} in search patterns will be replaced with the given baseurl
#
# {hash} will cause the named capture group to be replaced with the first 10 chars of its SHA256 hash.
# You can name the capture groups 'user', 'internal_email' and 'external_email', and the username or local part
# of the email address will be hashed to allow for attributability.
# The replacement provided will be ignored, but for understandabilities sake you should define it like it's done below.

#
# these email replacements are very slow, due to the amount of arbitrary quantifiers needed, but match very thoroughly

# (\w|\d)*?\S*(\w|\d)@URL_CLEANED||INTERNAL_EMAIL_CLEANED
